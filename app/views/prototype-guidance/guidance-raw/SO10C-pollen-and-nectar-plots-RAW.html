        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">About pollen and nectar plots</h2>

        <p>A pollen and nectar plot is an area of flowers created to provide insects with the food they need to survive and pollinate. A plot consisting of many flower species will provide food for different types of pollinators. Managing your plot will ensure that it provides pollen and nectar for an extended period of time.</p>

        <p>By creating a pollen and nectar plot you will:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>protect insects such as bees, butterflies and hoverflies which are declining in numbers</li>
          <li>help ensure pollination of food crops such as fruit and oilseed rape</li>
          <li>improve the health of nearby crops as the predatory insects using your plot feed on pests such as aphids</li>
          <li>provide food and shelter for farmland birds and their chicks</li>
          <li>add colour to the landscape</li>
        </ul> 

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to sow pollen and nectar plots</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Choose your location</h3>

        <p>Research has shown that the smallest solitary bees can fly around 250 metres between nectar and pollen sources. This means that from any flowering plot they should be able to reach other plots or crops within a circular range of nearly 20 hectares.</p>

        <p>When deciding where to locate your plots you should consider:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>whether any nectar sources already exist on your holding</li>
          <li>where your flowering crops which require pollination are located</li>
          <li>whether you have rights of way on your land and can locate your plots somewhere visible to the public</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should aim to establish a minimum of five plots of at least 0.5 hectares for every 100 hectares of farmland. This should meet the foraging needs of most pollinators.</p>

        <p>Space your plots as evenly as possible across your land. Pollinators will then be able to use them as stepping stones to reach other plots or nectar sources.</p>

        <p>Multiple large plots allow pollinators to move to safety when you are carrying out agricultural operations in adjacent crops, such as the spraying of insecticides.</p>

        <p>You can sow plots as a block within a field or as a margin along the edge. Margins can be useful for creating corridors which link isolated areas of flower-rich habitat.</p>

        <p>Your plot is most likely to be successful if you choose an area which is sunny and low in fertility.</p> 

        <p>You should avoid:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>sites with a history of persistent weed problems such as common ragwort, docks, nettles or thistles</li>
          <li>fertile sites that will encourage weeds which will outcompete your sown flowers</li>
          <li>cool, damp or shady locations beside hedgerows, tree lines or woodland</li>
          <li>remote or inaccessible sites which are difficult to access or manage</li>
          <li>areas known to support rare arable plants â€“ for these areas you should consider <a href="#" onclick="return false;">S015A Cultivated plots and margins for rare arable plants</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What to sow</h3>

        <p>A seed mix containing both legume and non-legume species will typically provide:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>high volumes of pollen and nectar between April and October</li>
          <li>a variety of flower colours and shapes that will be attractive to a range of pollinators such as bees, butterflies, hoverflies and wasps</li>
          <li>a plot which provides flowers every year for up to five years</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Do not include grasses in your mix as they can suppress the sown flower species.</p>

        <p>Sow a mix containing a minimum of 10 flowering species. At least four of these should be non- legumes. This should ensure that you still have at least five flowering species when your plot is four or five years old. At this point the short-lived species will be starting to decline in extent.</p>

        <p>If you have strongly acidic or alkaline soils then seek advice from your seed supplier when you are devising your mix. You should not include lucerne or sainfoin in a mix sown on acidic soils.</p>

        <p>Your plot has a greater risk of partial or total failure if you sow too few seeds. This is more likely if conditions arenâ€™t ideal during sowing and the first few weeks after germination. A poorly established plot is at risk of colonisation by weeds and will need to be re-sown sooner.</p>

        <p>Your overall sowing rate should take into account the following which may affect germination rate:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the relative seed size of flower species included in your mix</li>
          <li>seed-bed quality including available moisture within the seed-bed</li>
          <li>sowing date and weather conditions</li>
          <li>soil type</li>
          <li>weed and pest burden</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some species can become too dominant, or a potential future weed. You can minimise this risk by using the following maximum seed rates for these species:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>borage - 3.00 kg/ha</li>
          <li>chicory - 0.20 kg/ha</li>
          <li>lucerne - 0.60 kg/ha</li>
          <li>phacelia - 0.70 kg/ha</li>
          <li>sweet clover - 0.60 kg/ha</li>
        </ul> 

        <p>Your seed supplier should provide you with advice on an overall sowing rate on your land, for the mix you choose.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">When to sow</h3>

        <p>Pollen and nectar plots can be sown at any time if conditions are right for germination. This means:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>sowing into a well-prepared seedbed that is at least 7Â°C and has some available moisture</li>
          <li>completing autumn sowings by the first week of September to decrease the risk of frosts affecting establishment</li>
          <li>delaying sowing if your seedbed is extremely dry or saturated</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some annual species such as crimson or Persian clover are not frost-hardy. Do not include these in an autumn sown mix. Consult your seed supplier for advice on frost-hardy annuals if you will be autumn sowing.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Create your seedbed</h3>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>Control perennial weeds such as creeping thistle, couch grass and docks before you sow your seed mix.</li>
          <li>Produce a well consolidated, fine and level seedbed to ensure even germination and establishment.</li>
          <li>If your seedbed is still uneven after secondary cultivations then consider using a ring roll before sowing.</li>
        </ol> 

        <p>Be careful not to overwork your seedbed if you have light soils. This can lead to seed being sown too deep, or poor emergence due to â€˜cappingâ€™ where rain falls soon after sowing.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Sowing your seed</h3>

        <p>One of the most common causes of failure during establishment is sowing small seeds too deep using a conventional drill. The small seeds in your mix will germinate best when broadcast or very shallow-drilled onto the surface of your seedbed.</p>

        <p>Sow half of your seed in one direction and the other half at a 90 degree angle to it. This will help to distribute the different species evenly through your plot.</p>

        <p>It can be difficult to sow low quantities of seed in conventional equipment. You may need to mix in an inert carrier such as barley meal or poultry chick crumb to help with seed flow and achieve a more even distribution.</p>

        <p>If you are travelling between plots, make sure you mix the seed well immediately prior to sowing each plot.</p>

        <p>If the soil is dry enough, ring roll immediately after broadcasting to improve seed to soil contact, help retain moisture and reduce the risk of slug damage.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Check your plot</h3>

        <p> Check for pest damage and to determine germination success within eight weeks of sowing.</p>

        <p>If establishment is poor, you may need to re-sow part or all of your plot.</p>

        <p>Broadcasting or shallow drilling into the existing sward may be enough for small areas. You may need to cultivate lightly first to create some bare ground.</p>

        <p>If your plot has failed on a larger scale then you may need to start again.</p>

        <p>If you are unsure what to do then speak to your seed supplier or adviser.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Managing your pollen and nectar plot</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">First year management</h3>

        <p>Cutting at least twice during the first 12 months after sowing will:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>control annual weeds including crop volunteers</li>
          <li>encourage your sown species to bush out</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your first cut should be carried out when weeds are starting to shade out the flower seedlings.</p> 

        <p>Cutting early flowering annuals at the wrong time can prevent them from flowering. If your mix contains early flowering annuals such as black medick, common vetch, crimson clover or phacelia, cut either:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>early â€“ when the plants are less than 30cm high and do not have flower buds</li>
          <li>late â€“ after they have completed flowering</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should cut at a height which:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>removes the top growth of the target weeds</li>
          <li>does not dislodge the roots of your seedlings</li>
          <li>minimises the risk of harming wildlife such as young leverets</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To further reduce damage to wildlife, your cutting path should not force wildlife into a central area where it is hard for them to escape the final pass of your machinery.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">

        <p>After the first year your plot should be fully established. </p>

        <p>You now need to cut to extend the flowering period of your plot so that nectar is available to pollinators later in the summer. Do this by cutting half of the plot just before the flower bud formation stage. To get your timing right you will need to regularly check your plot in the spring. As soon as you see the first flower buds starting to form then you should cut. In most years cutting from late May to mid-June is likely to be the optimum time.</p>

        <p>The cut plants will take time to recover and produce flowers. This means that the cut half of your plot will flower later than the uncut half.</p>

        <p>You should alternate the half of the plot which is cut each year.</p>

        <p>Cut the whole area once your plot has finished flowering.</p>

        <p>Over time the number of plants flowering in your plot will reduce and the value to pollinating insects will fall. When there are less than five species flowering each year you should re-establish your plot. This is likely to be around five years after establishment.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Cut material</h3>

        <p>Where possible you should remove the cuttings to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>reduce the risk of mulching which could prevent the recovery of your plot after cutting</li>
          <li>reduce nutrient enrichment which could encourage weeds such as nettles and wild grasses</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If removal is not practical, you should make the cuttings as fine as possible using a heavy duty flail during dry conditions.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Grazing</h3>

        <p>You may use livestock to graze your plot:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>as an alternative to the early cut on 50% of your plot; but ensure that the sward is not grazed below 10cm in height to minimise the risk of damage to the crowns of your plants</li>
          <li>after, or as an alternative to, your end of season cut</li>
          <li>in early spring to help suppress grass weeds</li>
          <li>when planning to undertake spring weed-wiping and a height differential is needed between non-target plants and target weeds</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should ensure that any grazing does not cause poaching or compaction. Remove your winter grazing stock before the flowers start to grow the following spring.</p>

        <p>To avoid damaging your plot you should not supplementary feed.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Things to be aware of</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Broad-leaved weeds</h3>

        <p>If you have broad-leaved weeds such as common ragwort, docks, nettles or thistles which are hard to control then you may:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>remove by hand</li>
          <li>carry out repeated cutting of the affected area</li>
          <li>apply herbicide using a knapsack, hand-lance or weed-wiper</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Do not apply broad-leaved herbicide across the whole of your plot. Most products that are effective on weeds would also kill or severely damage your pollen and nectar species.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Grass weeds</h3>

        <p>Wild grasses can suppress your flowering plants and reduce the supply of pollen and nectar.</p>

        <p>If you have a problem with grasses on your plots you may use a selective herbicide. You must use a product which is effective on the target grass weeds but safe for the sown flower species.</p>

        <p>Always consult a British Agrochemical Standards Inspection Scheme (BASIS) qualified agronomist for up to date information on which products are approved for use on pollen and nectar plots.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Pest control</h3>

        <p>Pests can severely hamper the successful establishment of your sown flower mix.</p>

        <p>Pigeons, rooks and mice may take seeds that have not been covered adequately with soil. Consider shallow drilling your seed instead of broadcasting if you have a high pest burden. You may also use bird scaring devices.</p>

        <p>Slugs can be very damaging to seedlings soon after germination.</p>

        <p>Effective non-chemical control measures include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>ploughing to ensure that trash is buried to a depth which moves slugs away from the rooting zone</li>
          <li>producing a firm, fine, level seedbed which is rolled after sowing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should only use slug pellets as a last resort and in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Pesticidfe sprays</h3>

        <p>To avoid killing the pollinators using your plots, or the flowering plants themselves, you should be careful when applying insecticide or herbicide to adjacent crops. Consider establishing a chemical- free buffer zone such as <a href="#" onclick="return false;">low input cereal</a>, or a <a href="#" onclick="return false;">grass margin</a> around your plot to protect it from spray drift.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Legal requirements</h2>

        <p>Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 all birds, their nests and eggs are protected by law. It is an offence, with certain exceptions, to intentionally kill, injure or take any wild bird. It is also an offence to intentionally take, damage or destroy the nest of any wild bird whilst it is in use or being built.</p>

        <p>You should check your plots for signs of nesting birds before carrying out cutting. Where nests are present delay cutting until birds have fledged.</p>

        <p>Always consult a British Agrochemical Standards Inspection Scheme (BASIS) qualified agronomist when using chemicals to control weeds. A BASIS agronomist will provide you with up to date information on approved products, application methods, and application rates to suit your needs.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What a successful pollen and nectar plot should look like</h2>

        <p>You will know your management is right when you see:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>plants such as black medick, common vetch, phacelia and red campion starting to flower in spring, providing pollen and nectar for early emerging insects</li>
          <li>flowering plants in a variety of colours, shapes and sizes throughout the summer months</li>
          <li>plants such as common knapweed and musk mallow continuing to flower into late summer or early autumn</li>
          <li>a variety of pollinating insects such as bumblebees, butterflies, hoverflies, and solitary bees and wasps using your plot to feed</li>
        </ul>
