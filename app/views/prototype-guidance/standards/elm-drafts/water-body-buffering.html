        <h2 id="Aims" class="govuk-heading-l">Environmental aims of this standard</h2>
        <p>Water body buffers are strips of grassland you plant next to water. They create a physical barrier between water bodies and farm operations like:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>cultivation</li>
            <li>spraying</li>
            <li>fertiliser application</li>
            <li>livestock grazing</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This standard will help you maintain and improve:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>water quality, by preventing pollutants such as nutrients and pesticides from being transported in surface water runoff</li>
            <li>water body habitats for aquatic species, by reducing bankside erosion and transport of sediment and pathogens (organisms that can cause disease)</li>
            <li>land habitat for wildlife like insects and small mammals</li>
          </ul>

          <p>It will also increase resilience against climate change by:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>improving links between wildlife habitats</li>
            <li>helping to shade and cool rivers</li>
            <li>slowing the flow of surface water runoff</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 id="Payment" class="govuk-heading-l">Payment</h2>
        <p>You can choose one of three levels in this standard.</p>
        <p>Payment amounts relate to the actions you must perform to successfully complete each level. Payments do not stack - for example if you complete the advanced standard you will not also receive the basic payment amount.</p>

        <h2 id="Eligibility" class="govuk-heading-l">Eligibility</h2>

        <p>Use water body buffering on:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>arable and intensive grassland - typically grassland receiving more than 100kg nitrogen per hectare per year, next to ponds or lakes</li>
        <li>arable and intensive grassland next to rivers, streams, canals and field ditches, including temporarily dry watercourses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do not use water body buffering on:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>coastal waters</li>
        <li>estuaries</li>
        <li>sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs)</li>
        <li>ponds associated with industrial features such as effluent ponds, balancing ponds or small water supply reservoirs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can put grass buffers on undesignated land next to SSSI water bodies. You’ll need consent for any actions on the boundary of the SSSI, including related capital works such as watercourse fencing.</p>
        <p>Areas you have used for water body buffering can not then be entered into another standard, except the hedgerows standard.</p>


        <h2 id="HowTo" class="govuk-heading-l">How to complete this standard</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Actions you must complete at all levels of this standard</h3>

        <p>Carry out a runoff and soil erosion risk assessment. You should prioritise higher risk areas identified in the risk assessment when you choose where to put buffers.</p>
        <p>Establish and maintain 6 metre water body grass buffer strips next to water bodies. This must include the 2 metre cross-compliance buffer. You must apply this to at least 50% of the total length of water bodies entered into the standard.</p>
        <p>You must keep livestock off buffer strips.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Additional intermediate level actions</h3>

        <p>In addition to 6 metre buffer strips, you must establish and maintain 10 metre water body grass buffer strips next to water bodies. This must include the 2 metre cross-compliance buffer. You must apply this to at least 30% of the total length of water bodies entered into the standard.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Additional advanced level actions</h3>

      <p>You must include an appropriate wildflower mix in every buffer.</p>
      <p>In addition to 6 metre buffer strips, you must establish and maintain 10 metre water body grass buffer strips next to water bodies. This must include the 2 metre cross-compliance buffer. You must apply this to at least 30% of the total length of water bodies entered into the standard.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Optional actions</h3>
      <p>You will be paid an additional £3.50 per square metre per year if you establish in-field grass strips or blocks on cultivated land, where additional in-field measures are needed to intercept runoff water.</p>

      <h2 id="Success" class="govuk-heading-l">How you'll know if you've been successful</h2>
      <p><i>Are there inspections? Reports that need to be submitted by the land manager?</i></p>

        <h2 id="Guidance" class="govuk-heading-l">Guidance to help you complete this standard</h2>
        <p>This guidance will help you provide habitat for wildlife:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>create and maintain grass strips</li>
          <li>create and maintain field corners</li>
          <li>create and maintain flower-rich margins and plots</li>
          <li>create and maintain pollen and nectar plots</li>
          <li>create and maintain beetle banks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This guidance will help you provide food for wildlife:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>spring-sown winter bird food plots</li>
          <li>autumn-sown winter bird food plots</li>
          <li>autumn-sown bumblebird mix</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="Capital" class="govuk-heading-l">Capital items related to this standard</h2>
        <p>You may be able to get help with the costs of the following items:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>permanent and temporary livestock fencing and gates</li>
          <li>alternative water sources</li>
          <li>livestock troughs</li>
          <li>pasture pumps</li>
          <li>associated pipework and hard bases</li>
