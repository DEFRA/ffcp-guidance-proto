        <h2 id="What" class="govuk-heading-l">What a beetle bank is</h2>

        <p>A beetle bank is a permanent, raised, uncut, grassy strip in the middle of a field.</p>

        <p>It provides winter habitat for invertebrates like bees, predatory ground beetles and spiders. In spring they spread out onto the land to feed on aphids and other crop pests.</p>

        <p>Reducing crop pests can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>improve the health of crops</li>
          <li>increase productivity</li>
          <li>reduce the need for insecticides</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In summer the bank provides habitat for bees, mammals and farmland birds.</p>

        <p>Beetle banks can also help to control runoff, which can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>stop pollution from fertiliser or pesticide reaching sensitive habitats</li>
          <li>prevent soil eroding and getting into watercourses or onto roads</li>
          <li>slow or divert the flow of flood water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="How" class="govuk-heading-l">How to make a beetle bank</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Choosing a location</h3>

        <p>Where you make the bank depends on what you want it to do: reduce crop pests or help control runoff.</p>

        <p>If you’re making a beetle bank to control crop pests, it’ll be most effective in a field of over 20 hectares.</p>

        <p>Make the bank in the middle of the field so invertebrates can spread across the whole area during the summer.</p>

        <p>In larger fields of 30 to 50 hectares, build 3 to 4 banks. Space them evenly across the field.</p>

        <p>It’s easiest to make the bank in the same direction as you cultivate.</p>

        <p>If you want to use a beetle bank to control runoff and soil erosion then make it along the contour of the slope to get the best effect. Make sure the bank does not just divert water, causing problems somewhere else.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Making the bank</h3>

        <p>Make the bank in autumn.</p>

        <p>Plough in opposite directions to make a raised bank at least 40cm above the normal level of the field and between 3 and 5 metres wide. You might need to make a few passes.</p>

        <p>Make a firm, fine seedbed using shallow cultivation. Do not overwork the bank as this might flatten it.</p>

        <p>Leave a gap at both ends of the bank where it meets the field boundary or margin so that you can easily get machinery in and out.</p>

        <p>Leave the bank over winter and sow the following spring.</p>

        <p>You might need to spray with a herbicide before sowing if there are weeds.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What to sow</h3>

        <p>Sow tussocky grass species like:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>cock’s foot</li>
          <li>timothy</li>
          <li>meadow fescue</li>
          <li>tall fescue</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To cover bare ground under tall grasses, use fine-leaved creeping grasses like:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>sheep’s fescue</li>
          <li>common bent</li>
          <li>red fescue</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Tall flowers attract wildlife. Choose species like hogweed, wild carrot, chicory or knapweed, which can compete with thick grasses.</p>

        <p>Flowers provide food for pollinators and attract other predatory insects like hoverflies and parasitic wasps. Birds and harvest mice can also use the tall stems for nests and perching.</p>

        <p>Sow a seed mix with 3 or 4 tussocky species plus 2 or 3 finer grasses and flowers. Choose species suitable for your soil type and sow at a rate of 20kg per hectare.</p>

        <p>Broadcast onto the seedbed by hand or using light machinery, then roll. Use a light roller or hand roll after sowing to help the seed come into contact with the soil.</p>

        <h2 id="Maintain" class="govuk-heading-l">Maintaining a beetle bank</h2>

        <p>A beetle bank takes about 2 to 3 years to establish.</p>

        <p>In the first year, check the bank regularly to make sure the seed is growing and weeds don’t take over.</p>

        <p>Cut several times in the first summer to help grasses grow thickly. It’ll be hard for weeds to grow once grasses establish.</p>

        <p>You must check the bank for signs of nesting birds before cutting. If you see nests, delay cutting until birds fledge.</p>

        <div class="govuk-warning-text">
          <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
          <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
            <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
            Birds, nests and eggs are protected. If you kill birds or destroy nests or eggs you could be fined, sent to prison or both.
          </strong>
        </div>

        <p>After the first year, you’ll need to control problem (injurious) weeds, nettles and scrub. You can do this by:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>pulling by hand</li>
          <li>digging</li>
          <li>spot spraying herbicide</li>
          <li>cutting affected areas, but only in autumn or winter</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Insecticide and herbicide used on nearby crops can kill insects and plants. Protect the bank on each side with a buffer zone, like a strip of low-input cereal, a <a href="#" onclick="return false;">flower-rich margin</a> or <a href="#" onclick="return false;">pollen and nectar plot</a>.</p>

        <p>Fertiliser, manure or lime on the bank encourage weeds. If you need to spot spray problem weeds, only use an approved herbicide.</p>

        <p>Do not allow people to walk or drive over or alongside the beetle bank. This can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>erode ground or leave it bare</li>
          <li>increase weeds</li>
          <li>make the bank less effective</li>
          <li>damage wildlife</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="Look" class="govuk-heading-l">What a beetle bank should look like</h2>

        <p>You’ll see:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>thick tussocky grasses, including dead stems from previous seasons</li>
          <li>few weeds and little scrub</li>
          <li>invertebrates like ladybirds, ground beetles and spiders</li>
          <li>the bank acting as a barrier to runoff</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Very successful beetle banks will also have:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>farmland birds nesting and feeding</li>
          <li>small mammals like hares and harvest mice using the bank as shelter</li>
          <li>bumblebees and other pollinators</li></ul>
