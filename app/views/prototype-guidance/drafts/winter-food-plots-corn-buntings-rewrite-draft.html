        <h2 id="benefit-plots" class="govuk-heading-l">The benefit of winter bird food plots</h2>
        <p>Winter bird food plots are a valuable food source for birds during the winter. They can also provide insect food during spring and summer. During the growing season they can support rare arable plants, such as cornflower, pheasant’s eye and shepherd’s needle.</p>
        <p>Winter bird food plots can be used alongside other management techniques.</p>

        <h2 id="how-establish" class="govuk-heading-l">How to establish winter bird foot plots for corn buntings</h2>

        <h3 id="location" class="govuk-heading-m">Choose the right location</h3>
        <p>The best places to establish and manage corn bunting plots are:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>sunny and south or south-west facing</li>
          <li>fertile and weed-free</li>
          <li>near to other foraging and roosting habitats</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The worst places to establish and manage corn bunting plots are:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>sites with lots of weeds</li>
          <li>shady and/or north facing</li>
          <li>remote or inaccessible, such as field corners</li>
          <li>next to public highways or public rights of way</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="size-shape" class="govuk-heading-m">Choose the right size and shape</h3>
        <p>Plots for corn bunting should be at least 48m wide and 1ha.</p>
        <p>Smaller plots are more difficult to manage and often run out of seeds earlier in the winter. Larger plots, of at least 1ha, are most likely to supply seed throughout the winter. They are easier to establish and manage using large modern machinery.</p>

        <h3 id="what-to-sow" class="govuk-heading-m">What to sow</h3>
        <p>You can sow winter bird food plots in either spring or autumn.</p>
        <p>When using autumn-sown mixes, you need to make sure that you supply enough seed every winter. Autumn-sown mixes do not provide any seed in the first winter after establishment. Use autumn-sown winter bird food plots to provide no more than half of winter seed requirements for corn buntings.</p>

            <p>If your holding also supports tree sparrows, you can provide seed for them by replacing 1-2 kg/ha of white millet with red millet. Quinoa can also be included at 2 kg/ha, which will also benefit insects and provide song posts for singing corn buntings.</p>

        <h3 id="when-to-sow" class="govuk-heading-m">When to sow</h3>
        <p>Establish spring-sown plots between mid-March and early June.</p>
        <p>From March to April you should drill the cereal component at a sowing depth of 2.5cm. From late May you should drill the remaining crops at a sowing depth of 1cm.</p>
        <p>If you are sowing in one pass, sow from early May at a sowing depth of 1cm.</p>
        <p>Sow autumn-sown plots between September and the end of October, at a sowing depth of 1cm.</p>

        <h3 id="different-size-seeds" class="govuk-heading-m">How to sow different size seeds</h3>
        <p>Different size seeds often settle out during transit and drilling. Mix the seed in the hopper immediately before and during drilling. This prevents uneven distribution of crops in your plot.</p>
        <p>You can drill or broadcast seed, or both. To combine methods, drill cereals first, in late March or April. Then broadcast the smaller seeds into the developing cereals from May.</p>
        <p>Factors that will influence your choice include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>availability of equipment</li>
          <li>experience</li>
          <li>seed mix</li>
          <li>seed bed quality</li>
          <li>size of your plot</li>
          <li>your chosen establishment method</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If drilling, sow crops on a conventional 4-5 inch row spacing. You may wish to roll afterwards to help keep moisture, ensure good seed soil contact and reduce slug damage. On heavier soils, you may have to roll before sowing to get a level seed bed. Do not roll where there is a risk of capping.</p>
        <details class="govuk-details">
          <summary class="govuk-details__summary">
            <span class="govuk-details__summary-text">One-pass or two-pass operations</span>
          </summary>
          <div class="govuk-details__text">
            <p>Seed size varies considerably, which makes it difficult to sow all seeds in a mix at the correct depth. For instance, small seeded crops such as white millet, mustard and quinoa should be sown 1cm deep. Whereas cereal crops, such as spring barley, spring wheat and spring triticale should be sown at a depth of 2.5cm.</p>
            <p>The easiest way to sow all seeds at the right depth is to use a two pass operation:</p>
            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
              <li>Sow the cereal component between February and early April across the whole area, at a sowing depth of 2.5cm.</li>
              <li>Sow the remaining smaller seeded crops in May or June over the whole area at a sowing depth of 1cm. Sow either along or across the rows of cereals. Avoid rolling or drilling into the cereals if they have reached the stem extension growth stage. This may damage the cereal seedlings.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This method allows both the cereals and smaller seeded crops to be sown at the best time and at the correct seed depth. The downside with this approach is an early sown cereal crop may out compete the small seeded crops, such as white millet and mustard.</p>
            <p>Another approach is to use a one pass operation. Sow the entire mix as one operation in late April or early May at a sowing depth of 1cm. You will have to sow all seeds at the same depth. This will mean some seeds are not sown at their optimal depth, which will reduce germination for those crops. It is recommended that you sow at a shallower seed depth to ensure the smallest seeds are not sown too deep.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <h3 id="" class="govuk-heading-m">Crop nutrition</h3>
        <p>All the sown crops in your winter bird food plots will benefit from enough crop nutrition. Soil testing the plot areas is advisable and will help you know what fertiliser and how much to apply. N, P and K fertiliser is important, particularly where plots are grown on light soils or in the same place for several years.</p>
        <p>Organic manure or inorganic fertiliser will help seed production. Typical annual application rates of nitrogen are about 50-60 kg/ha of N. Apply similar amounts of P and K if needed. Manganese, lime and other nutritional products can help correct pH and other deficiencies.</p>
        <p>All fertiliser recommendations must be provided by a <a href="#">FACTS (Fertiliser Advisers Certification and Training Scheme) qualified adviser</a>. A FACTS adviser will take into account: soil type, soil N supply, soil test results, previous cropping and crop requirements.</p>


        <h3 id="" class="govuk-heading-m">Weed control</h3>
        <p>You do not need to keep winter bird food plots completely weed free. Many weeds, such as knotgrass, black bindweed, fat hen, and chickweed, are a valuable food source for farmland birds and other wildlife. They will enhance the food value of your winter bird food plots. Consider weed control where there is a high weed burden that will result in poor crop establishment and/or seed production.</p>
        <p>Weed control outside of the crop is generally more effective, as there are more options available. Weed control on an existing plot can be successful, but is usually more difficult. In an existing plot, there is a risk of herbicide damage to susceptible crops. There are also legal restrictions on which crops herbicides can be used on.</p>
        <p>Always consult with a <a href="#">BASIS (British Agrochemical Standards Inspection Scheme) qualified agronomist</a> when using herbicides in winter bird food plots. A BASIS agronomist will make sure you use the most appropriate product and that dose rates will be effective on target weeds and safe to all crops. Only use herbicides approved for use on land temporarily taken out of production or game cover.</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Avoid locations with a high weed burden. Weeds such as bristly ox-tongue, couch, creeping thistle, docks, redshank and alien millet species, such as barnyard grass or yellow foxtail, are hard to control in winter bird food plots.</li>
              <li>Control weeds before sowing. Cultivate to encourage weed seeds to germinate. Then spray these weeds with a non-selective herbicide, to achieve a sterile weed free seedbed. To achieve the best results, delay drilling and adjust your seed mix to include crops suited to later sowing.</li>
              <li>Where possible, move plots to a new weed-free location. Corn buntings will nest in the same place each year. If corn buntings use your winter bird food plots to nest in, do not move your plot too far from the original location.</li>
              <li>Overall application of herbicide, to control broad-leaved weeds, such as bristly ox-tongue, thistles, docks, nettle and rosebay willowherb.</li>
              <li>Spot application of herbicide. To control injurious and other hard to control broad-leaved weeds, such as bristly ox-tongue, thistles, docks, nettle and rosebay willowherb. Only use herbicides approved for use in hand-held equipment such as a knapsack or hand lance.</li>
              <li>Overall application of a graminicide herbicide, to control grass weeds such as barnyard grass and yellow foxtail. Some grass species, such as annual meadow-grass, black-grass, Italian rye-grass and wild oat can be partially or fully resistance to certain graminicides, giving little or zero control. Where the target grass weeds have known tolerance or resistance to graminicides, the use of these herbicides is not recommended.</li>
              <li>Hand removal of weeds. Remove injurious and hard to control weeds such as spear thistle, docks and common ragwort before they have completed flowering and set seed. This can be a very effective way of preventing weed seeds returning to the seed-bank.</li>
              <li>Localised topping of weeds. This approach may remove the seed heads of crops growing among the target weeds. It can also be harmful to wildlife, such as fledgling birds and leverets. So, localised topping should only ever:
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>be a last resort</li>
                  <li>be operated at least 30cm off the ground, to minimise harm to wildlife</li>
                  <li>be applied to no more than 10% of the plot area</li>
                 </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

        <h3 id="how-long" class="govuk-heading-m">How long to keep plots</h3>
        <p>Keep plots until the beginning of March to maximise the amount of time that you provide seeds and cover habitat for corn buntings. On heavier soils that require a longer cultivation window to prepare a consolidated, firm, fine and level seedbed, keep plots until the start of February. This allows more time for weathering to help break down the soil and create a more workable seedbed.</p>

        <h3 id="failed" class="govuk-heading-m">Failed or poorly-established winter bird food plots</h3>
        <p>Assess germination success of spring-sown plots within 4 weeks of sowing and within 8 weeks for autumn-sown plots. Where establishment is poor it may be necessary to re-sow part of or the entire plot. Each situation will be different, depending on the remaining plant population and when re-sowing has to take place. Broadcasting seed into a standing crop may be appropriate, or in the worst cases you may need to start again.</p>
        <p>Consider how previous herbicide use may affect the success of re-establishment attempts. Many herbicides have some residual activity and low levels may still be present in the soil. If you are unsure, consult with a BASIS-qualified agronomist or seed supplier.</p>

        <h2 id="pest-control" class="govuk-heading-l">Pest control on winter corn bunting plots</h2>

        <h3 id="" class="govuk-heading-m">Flea beetle</h3>

        <p>Flea beetle damage can be an issue on brassica and oilseed crops such as mustard, particularly at early crop emergence stage. Establishment in good growing conditions, when soil and air temperatures are warmer, can sometimes help plants grow away from flea beetle damage. Bad damage which affects establishment may warrant an insecticide treatment. Any recommendation should be made by a BASIS qualified agronomist and applied in accordance with the label requirements.</p>

        <h3 id="" class="govuk-heading-m">Slugs</h3>

        <p>Slugs can be a significant problem, particularly on heavier soils and where plots are repeatedly sown in the same place. The most effective slug control method is to produce a firm level seedbed by rolling after sowing.</p>
        <p>Slug pellets can accidentally poison non-target species and contaminate surface and ground waters if not applied correctly. So, only use them as a last resort. If you plan to use slug pellets:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>test bait first to confirm damaging slug population thresholds are being exceeded</li>
          <li>consider using ferric phosphate based pellets, which show very low toxicity to other wildlife</li>
          <li>always apply metaldehyde based pellets in accordance with current Metaldehyde Stewardship best practice. <a href="https://www.getpelletwise.co.uk">Find out more about metaldehyde pellets</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="" class="govuk-heading-m">Other pests</h3>

        <p>Plots can also be attractive to a range of other pests such as hares, rabbits, pigeons and deer. Check crops regularly in the early stages. Use appropriate measures to prevent constant grazing, if necessary.</p>


        <h2 id="supplementary" class="govuk-heading-l">Supplementary feeding</h2>

        <p>You can mow strips up to 2-3m wide and 100m long through plots in December and January to help birds access shed seeds. Corn buntings will use these open areas to land and access the plot. You can also use these paths as a site for supplementary feeding.</p>
        <p>If your winter bird food plot has failed and you are unable to re-sow, you can provide supplementary food as a temporary alternative. Supplementary feeding between September and February will help replace the seed from a failed winter bird food plot. <a href="#">Supplementary feeding guidance</a> will help you provide the best supplementary food for corn buntings.</p>
